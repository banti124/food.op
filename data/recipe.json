Electric kettles are fast and convenient.\nli If infusing a pot of tea, pour some hot tap water into your teapot and let stand for about several seconds to a minute to pre-warm it. Alternately, you can swish some of the hotter boiling water from your kettle around in the teapot for a few seconds. Pour out this water before adding the tea to the teapot.\nli If using loose tea, prepare the tea\nolli Commonly one-half to one tea measure (or rounded teaspoon if you do not have a tea measure) is added per desired cup of tea. Some people add an extra measure \"for the pot\" (e.g., if 4 cups of tea are desired, 5 measures of tea would be used. It really is a matter of personal preference.)\nli If you are using an infuser, be sure it is closed tightly so the tea does not spill into the pot. Rinse the tea-filled infuser briefly under cool tap water to wash away tiny flakes that would otherwise drift into the teapot.\nli If using a filter basket infuser, do not overfill the basket (refer to the instructions that came with your basket). The brief rinse is usually not necessary unless the basket's mesh is quite porous.\nli Simply dropping loose tea into the teapot is also an option, though you may want to strain the tea as you pour it into the cups.\nli Place the tea or tea bag into the teapot.\nli When the water reaches the preferred temperature (see note below), pour it from the tea kettle into the teapot or single-serving teacup. As you pour, try to avoid pouring directly onto the tea (especially important for green and white teas) to avoid scalding the leaves.\nli Allow the tea to infuse quietly (i.e., do not stir the teapot or \"dunk the teabag\"). Agitating the tea releases more of the bitter compounds and degrades the taste. Watch the time to avoid over-infusion (see note below), and remove the infuser or tea bag when the time is up. If you did not use an infuser or tea bag, pour the tea into cups for immediate consumption.\nli Remember that the tannins in tea stain, so it is advisable to pour the tea over a non-staining surface, wipe up any spills quickly, and do not leave tea standing in a teapot for long periods of time.\ndivp\n;Adding sweeteners and lemon or milk\nTea bags are convenient, but tea purists often despise themp\nulli Generally, green and white teas need no sweetener or milk added to them for a delicious taste if prepared properly. some research indicates that adding lemon to green tea may make some of the healthful compounds in the tea more easily available to the body, and it provides a different, fresh taste to the tea.\nli Lemon lightens the color of tea and may accentuate any bitterness in the tea\nli Lemon pairs well with citrus-flavored teas, such as the bergamot-enhanced \"Grey\" teas (e.g., Earl Grey, Lady Grey, etc.), and unflavored black teas. Milk pairs well with sweet, flowery, or \"fruity\" teas, or with any black tea in which you wish to reduce bitterness.\nli Never combine milk and lemon in the same cup of tea or the milk will curdle into lumps.\nli Always add sweeteners to tea before adding any milk; otherwise, the milk will cool the tea, and the sweetener will not dissolve properly. For better dissolving, it is preferable to add several small amounts of sweetener to the tea, stirring each time, rather than adding a large amount of sweetener at once.\nli Chai teas by definition require the addition of milk, ranging from one-fourth to one-half of the total volume, and a sweetener. The milk may be warmed if serving hot chai. Otherwise, cold milk and ice cubes make a lovely iced chai.\ndivp\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Aam panna", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Beverage recipes", "Indian recipes", "Mango recipes", "Vegetarian recipes", "Vegan recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Aam panna", "ingredient_count": 6, "servings": null, "ingredients": ["4 medium-sized green Mango\n", "\u00bd cup (120 mL) Sugar\n", "2 level tablespoons (30 mL) Salt\n", "1 level teaspoon (5 mL) roasted Cumin seeds\n", "1 roasted Chili \n", "A handful of fresh Mint leaves\n"], "id": 123726, "procedure": "Procedure p\nolliCut mangoes into 3 slices each - two from either side of the seed and one with the seed in it.\nliPressure cook mangoes with one small cup of water.

Your hands should be completely dry and the same person should continue the other processes; a lot of different hands will spoil the pickle.\nli Pour half of the oil on the pieces and mix well with your hands.

The quantity of salt and chili powder needed in the pickle differ depending on several factors. Add salt and/or chili powder if necessary but be cautious in the quantity. The added quantities should be small to only tweak the taste and not alter completely.

Let stand for 3 minutes.\nli Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.\nli Mix the cool water, yeast mixture and flour gently with your fingers to form a mass.\nli On a lightly-floured work surface, knead for 5 minutes. The dough should now be supple and resilient.\nli Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a light towel.\nli Let the dough rest for 25 minutes - this period is called the autolyse.\nli Knead the dough for 6 - 8 minutes. Overkneading could make an overly tough dough; you're looking for a dough that is smooth and stretchy.\nliThe first rise\nulli Lightly oil a bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with a tea towel.\nli Let rise at room temperature (75-77\u00b0F) for 1 1/2 - 2 hours (until the volume doubles).\nli Gently deflate the dough. Fold it over itself , then reshape into a ball. Cover again with a tea towel.\nli Let rise for 1 1/4 hours or until it doubles again.\nli Once again, gently deflate the dough. Reshape into a round and cover, letting it rise for about 1 hour.\nliShaping the loaves\nulli On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each).\nli Take one piece and gently stretch into a rectangle, leaving some large bubbles in the dough.\nli Fold the top third down and the bottom third up.\nli Form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm.\nli Fold the dough over about a third of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat.\nli You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure.\nli Set aside on the work surface to relax before elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with remaining pieces of dough.\nli Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by rolling it back and forth on the work surface. Begin with both hands over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the loaf reaches the desired length. Make sure that the loaves don't exceed the length allowed by the oven.\nliThe second rise\nulli Place the finished loaves on a peel or upside down baking sheet lined with parchment paper and generously sprinkled with cornmeal or on a baguette pan.\nli Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic or a floured cloth and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes until the loaves are slightly plump but still not doubled in volume. The final rise is short, because you want the baguettes to be slightly under proofed; this will give them a better oven spring, resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and more flared cuts.\nliPreparing for baking\nulli Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F.\nli Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty water pan directly under the stone.\nli Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on the top of each baguette. The cuts should run from one end of the loaf to the other, rather than across it, and the blade should be held at a 30\u00b0 angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open in the oven. Be careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate the loaves.\nli Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves.\nliBaking\nulli Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the baguette mold in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and quickly close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the loaves and oven walls 6 to 8 times and close the door. After 2 more minutes, spray the loaves and the oven walls again.\nli Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400\u00b0F and bake for 25 - 30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden brown and crisp.

Count to 20, then carefully pour away the water. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, peel away the skin, halve the tomatoes, squeeze out most of the pips and juice into an empty bowl, and discard. Chop the flesh roughly and put it down on a plate to one side.\nli Peel and finely chop the onion. Fry the onion in the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over low to medium heat for about ten minutes, stirring from time to time so that it turns an even golden brown. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't burn.\nli Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the ginger and the garlic.\nli Slit the chilli using a sharp knife. Slice the flesh away from the cluster of seeds in the middle. Avoid touching any part of the chilli with your fingers if you can, as it is very easy to get chilli in your eyes, and that will sting. You can use a fork to hold the chilli down or wear rubber gloves. Chop the chilli finely.\nli Measure the ground spices into a teacup. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli to the pan, stir them around and fry for another minute or so. If you want your curry to be hot as well as spicy, include some or all of the chilli seeds. Then add the spices in the cup into the onions. Fry the spices for a minute or two, stirring all the time so that they do not stick. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nli Pour in the water and the tomatoes, bring to the boil, turn down the heat a little and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes.\nli Add the chicken pieces to the pan and stir them around so they are covered with the sauce. Put the lid on the pan, turn the heat down and let the chicken cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Chicken thighs will take longer to cook than breast pieces.\nli Now add the yoghurt to the chicken and stir it in. When the sauce is gently bubbling again, scoop up a little in a teaspoon, blow it cool and taste it. The sauce will probably taste quite sweet because of the tomatoes. Cut the lime in half and squeeze its juice into the sauce. Stir and taste again, and decide whether you want to add the second half.\nli Finally, chop the fresh coriander leaves and sprinkle them on to the curry just before you serve it with the rice.\np\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Banitsa", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Bulgarian recipes", "Pastry recipes", "Recipes_with_metric_units", "Vegetarian recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Banitsa", "ingredient_count": 7, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 2 packets of cookbook:phyllo dough, a low fat pastry, (Bulgarian \"fini kori\" or phyllo from the frozen desserts section)\n", " 200 grams of yellow Cheese (Bulgarian kashkaval or a mixture of cookbook:Cheddar Cheese and cookbook:mozzarella)\n", " 500 grams of white cheese (Bulgarian sirene or cookbook:Feta Cheese)\n", " 7 Eggs\n", " 100 grams of cookbook:butter\n", " 1/2 cup of soda water\n", " 1 cup cookbook:yogurt\n"], "id": 18233, "procedure": "Procedurep\nolli Mix six of the eggs, the grated butter, the crumbled white cheese, the yellow cheese cut in small pieces, and the yogurt. \nli In a buttered pan, lay a layer of the phyllo dough, spread a layer of the mixture, and continue alternating layers so that the phyllo and the mixture are finished about the same time. \nli Finish with a layer of phyllo dough. \nli Cut the banitsa into serving pieces. \nli Mix the last egg with the soda water and stir. \nli Pour the mixture over the banitsa and make sure there are no pieces of the phyllo dough left dry.\nli Bake in a preheated oven at 200 \u00b0C (390 \u00b0F) for 40 minutes, or until golden.

Roll over so it is coated with the oil.\nliAllow dough to rise and double in volume in a warm place for 1-1\u00bd hours, or in a cool place like a fridge for 2-3 hours.

Next \npadd the sugar and leave to stand for 20 minutes, so the juices from the berries and the sugar have a chance to mix.  This will also pull the juices out of the berries \npand give you a wonderful red and fruity looking mixture.\np:Peel, core and finely chop the apples and add them to the mixture.  Tart apples like cooking apples work really well as the sugar will add all the sweetness that you \npwant.\np:Once the mixture has been standing for 20-30 minutes, put it on the hob and heat gently to cook the apple.  Don't heat it too much at this stage, or boil the \npmixture, or it could burn. Ideally you want the finely chopped apple pieces to begin to break up and start to dissolve into the mixture. This could take a while, so \npkeep an eye on it and keep stirring it every now and then.\np:Once the apple is starting to break up, then turn the heat up and bring the mixture to the boil, and boil hard until the jam starts to set.\np:Meanwhile, you need to sterilize some jars.  Now in the interests of saving the planet, I always recycle jars (unless you are giving jam as a present, say at \npChristmas - and I will be giving jam at Christmas, and then I think it's about acceptable to buy fresh jars - as long as you make the recipient of the jam promise to \nprecycle or re-use the jam).\np:To make sure the jars are sterile, give them a good wash and then simply pop them in the oven for a bit to kill any lurking bacteria.  Alternatively, use sterilizing \npsolution.  It's a very good idea to do this as it stops the jam from going mouldy when you store it for use later.\np:To test if the jam is near setting, put a small bit of jam on a spoon and place it on an ice cube then leave it to cool down.  Once its cool, push it with your \npfinger and if it crinkles and keeps its shape, then it is just about right.  When doing this, make sure the jam has cooled enough to touch or else you will burn your \npfingers!\np:Once the jam has reached this stage, it's ready to be put into the jars, and have the lids put on.  Be very careful at this stage, it the jam is extremely hot!  Let \npthe jars cool overnight, then store in a cool, dark place until needed.  And by needed I mean spread on toast for breakfast, spooned over ice-cream, put in pies and \nptarts and perhaps just eaten off the spoon in a self-indulgent moment when no-one is looking.\np{{wikipedia|Bilberry}}\n{{wikipedia|Apple}}\np{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}"}, {"category": null, "title": "Bilberry Compote", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Compote recipes", "Bilberry recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Bilberry Compote", "ingredient_count": 4, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 1 lb Fresh or frozen Bilberry\n", " 8 oz Cater Sugar \n", " 1/4 pint Water \n", " 1 tablespoon Redcurrent jelly\n"], "id": 278377, "procedure": "Procedurep\npGETTING READY\np1.

Unfortunately, it can be hard to find outside of Vietnam, so an \"inferior\" paste may be substituted.\npSaut\u00e9 the small onion in 3 tbsp of oil until golden brown. In your stockpot, combine the cooked onion and pigs feet with 2 litres of water. Slowly bring it to the boil over medium heat. Add lemongrass and '''SLOWLY and '''CAREFULLY pour in the shrimp paste mixture making sure to only add the clear liquid not the silt that has settled at the bottom of the bowl. To the residual shrimp paste, add another litre of water and stir. Again, wait until the mixture has settled before adding it into the stockpot. Simmer the stock for 20 minutes.\npAdd the beef and occasionally skim the broth to ensure you get a nice clear liquid. Cook for another 20 minutes, checking the beef to be sure it\u2019s not overcooked. Add fish sauce and sugar to taste to achieve a nice balance between salty and sweet.\npWhile the broth is cooking, heat some oil in a pan and add the red pigment. Cook until the pigment is blended with the oil. Add to the stock. Repeat the process with the chilli powder.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Burgoo", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Southern recipes", "Meat recipes", "Okra recipes", "Bean recipes", "Corn recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Burgoo", "ingredient_count": 16, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 1 pound mixed cooked Meat and poultrys (beef, lamb, pork, chicken, game, etc.)\n", " \u00bd gallon chicken stock\n", " \u00bd gallon beef stock\n", " 1 ounce Worcestershire Sauce\n", " 1 cup tomato, diced\n", " 1 large onion, diced\n", " 1 stalk celery, diced\n", " 1 small green Bell Pepper, diced\n", " 1 large potato, diced\n", " 2 large carrot, diced\n", " \u00bc cup pea\n", " \u00bd cup okra\n", " \u00bc cup Lima Bean\n", " \u00bd cup yellow corn\n", " 2 teaspoons garlic, mincing\n", " salt and pepper to taste\n"], "id": 150305, "procedure": "Procedurep\nolli Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.\nli Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, skimming the top as needed.\npTraditional burgoo was often cooked out doors in a cast iron kettle over a wood fire.

Discard the soak water before cooking - your pot plants will love it!\nliCook the beans until soft:\nulliIf using a stove-top method, simmer them in lots of water until they are very soft. You'll need to cook the beans a very long time on very low heat. You may add salt or black pepper to the water. You may add onion halves or a ham bone, which you can remove at the end. Changing the water from time to time will reduce the risk of gas. Expect the cooking to take at least 3 hours, if not 6 or more.\nliIf using a pressure cooker, place the beans and some flavoring (typically salt) in enough water to cover all the beans fully, and bring to pressure.

Heat on a stovetop.\nli Slice the onions into fairly thin slivers. When the oil is very hot, add the onions.\nli Turn the stove down to a low heat, so the onions just gently saut\u00e9. After around 3 minutes they should be starting to caramelize.\nli Gradually turn up the heat and keep stirring the onions. You want them to brown quite heavily without burning.\nli Add the white wine vinegar, it will sizzle, and after a while will evaporate. Keep stirring. Fry for several more minutes, until they are very brown, but not burnt.\nli Remove the onions from the pan into a bowl, taking care to let as much oil as possible drip back into the pan. You should now have a bowl of nicely crisped fried onions.\nli Add the onions to a blender or food processor. Add around 1 tablespoon of oil, and process for around a minute until you have a fairly thick, dark brown sauce. This is the basic onion sauce from which vindaloo is made. It's also the onion sauce that gives the vindaloo the majority of its 'hot' taste, as it builds up as you eat the dish.\nli Remove sauce from blender and set aside.\nli '''Make the garlic/chili paste\nolli Coarsely chop the garlic cloves (and ginger if you're using it). De-seed the chili peppers and chop in the same way. Add the chopped garlic and chillies to the food processor. \nli Blend the garlic and chillies until you have a fairly grainy (but liquid) sauce. For this I used an attachment on my blender which is intended to grind coffee beans. It has a much smaller container and so there's less waste.\nli Add the turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala and cinnamon to the sauce. Stir it until it's well mixed, and set aside.\nli Gently crush the black peppercorns in a mortar and pestle. Once coarse, add the mustard seed and rock salt. Continue blending until all the spices form a nice coarse powder.\nli '''Cook the paste and meat\nolli Pour a little oil into a saucepan. Add the spiced garlic and chili paste to the pan. It needs to be slightly floating on oil, not touching the bottom of the pan.\nli When the sauce is quite hot and bubbling, add the chopped meat. Keep stirring so the meat absorbs the spice mix, until it is browned and mostly cooked.\nli '''Add onion sauce and simmer\nolli Now add the onion sauce to the pan. After stirring for 1 minute, add a little water and stir for another 2 minutes, then turn the heat to quite low. The sauce at this stage should be quite runny, and orange/tan in color. Remember a lot is going to evaporate off as it cooks.\nli At this stage you can add some vegetables. Half a cup of frozen peas works well.\nli Place a lid over the pan, and cook for around 30-40 minutes. Keep checking and stirring the pan every 5 or 10 minutes to make sure it doesn't stick or burn.The sauce will darken in color as it cooks.\nli Towards the last 15 minutes of cooking time, boil 2 cups of pilau, or basmati rice in a pan.\nli To serve- spoon the curry over the top of the rice.

A 10kg ham is considered better-tasting as the pig has gotten bigger. \nli Before putting the ham in the oven, take it out from the refrigerator and let come closer to room temperature. If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning. The ham should be about 10 degrees C (50 F)  when you put it in the oven.\nli Use a wet paper towel to clean the ham a bit; then dry it.\nliPlace ham on baking tray in oven, with some water on the tray. Or, if you have a large roasting bag, there is no need for water. \nli Note: do not use only the grill as it lets drop all the liquid from the ham, messing up your oven if the roasting bag fails. However, you can use the grill and put the ham on it and baking tray beneath that. An aluminum foil can also be used on the baking tray. \nli Preheat oven to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (you can skip this if you are not worried about the possible bacteria on the ham) and let ham roast in the warm oven for half an hour, then turn temperature down. \nli Cook at 100-125\u00a0\u00b0C, for about 1 hour/kilo, so a 7 kg ham will take 7 hours or more, until meat thermometer shows 75-80\u00a0\u00b0C. 'Traditional' ham is ready at 80\u00a0\u00b0C but most take the ham out of the oven at 77\u00a0\u00b0C or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier.\nli The use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. Thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water - it should show about 100\u00a0\u00b0C.\nli After you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer. It is recommended you do not pour the liquid from the bag or baking tray down the drain.\nli Wait until ham is cool enough to handle, then glaze it with mustard and breadcrumbs. First remove the rind from the ham, then cover the ham with mustard, then with breadcrumbs. Put in 250\u00a0\u00b0C oven for 10 minutes.\nli Ham is ready to eat when it has cooled down a bit. This makes about enough for 3 or 4 people for a week, but if you think you will not eat it all within a week, freeze the rest.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Christmas Pudding", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Dessert recipes", "Fruit recipes", "Christmas recipes", "Recipes with metric units"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Christmas Pudding", "ingredient_count": 15, "servings": null, "ingredients": ["\u00bd Pound (225g) Raisins\n", "\u00be lb (340g) Currants\n", "\u00bd lb (225g) Sultanas\n", "\u00bd lb (225g) Sugar (or less)\n", "\u00be lb (340g) shredded Suet (can be vegetarian; see note below)\n", "\u00bd lb (225g) Breads\n", "\u00bc lb (110g) crystallised peel\n", "2 Teaspoon Cinnamon\n", "2 Ounce (55g) Almonds (chopped, but not too small)\n", "1/3 Cup (about 60g) Flour\n", "1/3 Pint (about 190ml) Milk\n", "3 large Eggs (beaten)\n", "Brandy\n", "Juice and rind of 1 Lemon\n", "1/3 of a Nutmeg\n"], "id": 4298, "procedure": "Procedurep\nolliMix and stir well.\nliPlace in pudding basins, and cover with cloths or buttered greaseproof paper, tied tightly in place with string.\nliSteam for 7 hours and keep till Christmas Day.\nliTo prepare for serving, steam for 2 hours.

When it is boiling, carefully break the eggs into it. If you have cooking rings, you can put these into the water first and then break the eggs into the rings, to prevent the eggs from spreading too much - although really fresh eggs should stay together anyway. Once the eggs are in the pan, wait a few moments for the water to heat up again, then turn the heat down to a very very gently simmer. To ensure the tops of the eggs are cooked, spoon water from around the edge of the pan over the top of the eggs a few times during cooking. When cooked, the egg white should be soft but cooked through and the yolk still runny.\nli Put the halved tomatoes under the grill with the sausages.\nli If using, put the baked beans into a pan and heat through over a medium heat.\nli Heat up a very small amount of oil in another pan, and fry the mushrooms until they are soft.\nli Put the bacon under the grill along with the sausages and tomatoes. Cook on one side for about 2 minutes, then turn once and repeat. Cook longer if crispier bacon is preferred.\nli Whilst cooking the bacon, use a toaster or grill to toast the bread until golden.\nli Serve the eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausage, tomato and beans onto piping hot plates, with the toast on a separate plate or toast rack. Serve with butter and jam for the toast, and hot tea with milk.\npAs a timing guide, here is how long (approximately) each item takes to cook:\nulli sausages - 10-15 mins\nli eggs - 8-10 mins\nli tomatoes - 6 mins\nli beans - 5 mins\nli mushrooms - 4 mins\nli bacon - 4 mins\nli toast - 3 mins\npHowever, if you can't cope with doing it all at once (or don't have enough pans / rings), it is possible to keep all of the items warm in a preheated oven, so you can just cook each item in turn and keep it warm until needed. Try not to keep the eggs warm for too long before serving though, as the yolks may harden.\n\"Unhealthy\" Versionp\npThey use the same ingredients as above and are more in keeping with the spirit of the dish.\npolli While frying the other ingredients, toast the bread in a grill or toaster.  Assuming 2 slices per person, you should have enough by the time you finish the fried food.  Be sure to butter them heavily with real butter rather than low-fat spread.  Place 4 plates on the bottom shelf of an oven, and one on the top.  Set the oven to its lowest heat.\nli Melt some lard in a large frying pan (enough to make a layer of fat around 1cm deep) and brown the sausage in it over a high heat.  Lower heat and cook the sausage for around 4 minutes, leave it in the pan.  A lot of fat will leak from the sausages.  Add the bacon (2 strips per person rather than 1) and cook to taste, flipping regularly (2-3 minutes for pink, 4-6 for a darker red bacon with crispy fat).  The bacon will also release a lot of fat.  Transfer the bacon to the warmed dish in the top of the oven.  Leave the sausage in the pan.\nli Add the mushrooms and tomatoes to the pan. Add the tin of baked beans to a small pot and heat on a separate ring.  After 2-4 minutes, transfer the mushrooms to the oven with the bacon. Transfer the tomato then too, or leave it a little longer depending on taste.\nli The sausages should now be dark brown, push them to the side of the pan and break an egg into the fat.  Using a spatula, push hot fat over the yolk until it begins to bubble but is still liquid.  This should take about 1 minute or so in a hot pan.  Set out the 4 warmed plates beforehand and add an egg to each.  When done, add the sausage, bacon, and mushrooms.  Add the beans last.

This can be caused by the wrong  proportion of liquid to fat.  In mayonnaise making, the problem occurs as a result of adding the oil too quickly. In a fondue the problem may occur in a number of ways:\npolliWhen using the traditional method (straight wine and cheese), melting occurs too rapidly.\nliThe water boils off leaving too much fat in proportion to aqueous component.\nliThe aqueous component is too great to hold an emulsion.\nliThere is insufficient starch to stabilize the emulsion.\nliA combination of the above.\npThe most effective solution is to: \nolliDissolve some more cornstarch in a half cup (50 ml) of wine.\nliPut the fondue back on the stove top over medium heat.\nliWhen it is boiling, lower the heat and slowly add the slurry while beating vigorously until thickening of the starch has occurred.\nliIf it is too thick, add more wine, a little at a time until the right consistency is achieved, stirring constantly.\nliIf necessary add some more grated cheese to taste.\npOnce you learn how it's done, this is always effective.\np{{PAGENAME}}"}, {"category": null, "title": "Four in one pizza", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Inexpensive recipes", "American recipes", "Cheese recipes", "Chicken recipes", "Ham recipes", "Onion recipes", "Pineapple recipes", "Tomato recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Four in one pizza", "ingredient_count": 6, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" Cooking Spray\n", " Cornmeal\n", " 1 can refrigerated pizza crust\n", " 2 Teaspoon Olive Oil\n", " \u00bd Cup (2 Ounce) shredded Cheddar Cheese\n", " 1\u00bd cups (6 ounces) shredded Mozzarella Cheese\n"], "id": 127665, "procedure": "Procedurep\npolli Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.\nli Spray cookie sheet with cooking spray.\nli Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, if desired.\nli Unroll pizza dough and press out on cookie sheet into a 12 by 14 inch shape.\nli Brush with olive oil.\nli Bake crust 6 or 8 minutes.\nli Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese in a cross shape to divide crust in fourths.\nli In each corner, spread one of the above toppings (or one of your own!).\nli Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top of all.\nli Bake another 10 to 14 minutes,until cheese is bubbly but not burned.\nli Cut each corner into 4 squares.\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Frapp\u00e9 Coffee", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Beverage recipes", "Greek recipes", "Coffee recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Frapp\u00e9 Coffee", "ingredient_count": 5, "servings": null, "ingredients": ["1-2 spoons of instant coffee\n", "Tall Glass of Cold Water\n", "1-3 spoons of sugar (optional)\n", "3-5 ice cubes (optional)\n", "Milk (optional; condensed/evaporated milk works best)\n"], "id": 20252, "procedure": "Procedure \nulliPut coffee and sugar in a shaker or tall glass and add a little water, just enough to cover the mixture (about 10 ml, or a couple of teaspoonfuls). \nliShake or stir with mixer until the mixture becomes foamy.  \nliFill the glass with cold water.  \nliAdd ice cubes, milk (preferably evaporated or condensed milk) or cream to taste. \nliSip with a straw.\nVariantp\nInstead of shaking the initial coffee/sugar/water mix, it can also be beaten with a teaspoon.

One more layer of remaining chicken, finally with layer of rest of the rice on top ends the rice-chicken layering stage.\nli Heat oil and deep fry half the sliced onions to golden brown. Similarly fry cashew. Garnish the top layer with these two along with 100 ml ghee, coconut milk, saffron rice grains and coriander. Lid the vessel and try making it airtight (but no pressure should build up). Put on high flame for 5 min before reducing it to low flame. The flame should NOT be at the vessel's centre, but on one side of it. Wait for 2-3 min and turn the vessel to heat other next part on its circumference. This way, keep rotating the vessel every 2-3 min for about 20 min. Every time you turn it, carefully disturb the contents by a shake/jerk so as to avoid settling of ghee at the bottom.\nli Put off the flame and wait for about 10 min before opening. Before serving, mix the medley from the bottom. Serve with boiled egg halves. Enjoy. Rightly and carefully made, its an epicure's paradise.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Hyderabadi haleem", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": [], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Hyderabadi haleem", "ingredient_count": 11, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 200gms whole wheat\n", " 300gms boneless mutton\n", " 20gms fresh green chillies\n", " 2\" piece ginger\n", " 6-8 flakes garlic\n", " 100gms cooking oil\n", " 3 medium onions (sliced)\n", " 2 medium limes\n", " 1/2tsp turmeric powder (Haldi)\n", " 2tsp Garam Masala\n", " Salt to taste \n"], "id": 187796, "procedure": "Procedure\nolli De-bran the wheat, wash and soak for 2 hours.\nli Clean and marinate mutton with half of ground paste of ginger, garlic, green chillies and salt for 1 hour.\nli Pressure cook the soaked wheat and marinated meat for about 45 minutes.

The water usually ceases to boil for a short while after the dumplings have been placed into the pot. Wait until it boils again and then reduce heat. Let the dumplings boil slowly until they start rising to the surface of the water. Now cover the pot and wait for about another 4 minutes. The dumplings will gain size during this period.\nliIn the meantime heat butter in a pan, add breadcrumbs with sugar and a bit of ground cinnamon. Fry the breadcrumbs until they turn light brown. Then roll the dumplings in the breadcrumbs until they are covered all over. \nliServe the Marillenkn\u00f6del together with the remaining breadcrumbs and coat them with much powdered sugar.\np{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}"}, {"category": null, "title": "Marinara Sauce", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Italian recipes", "Pasta sauces", "Tomato recipes", "Sauce recipes", "Duplicate recipes", "Recipes_with_metric_units"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Marinara Sauce", "ingredient_count": 9, "servings": null, "ingredients": ["6 tablespoons virgin cookbook:olive oil\n", "225 grams (8 ounces) Spanish cookbook:onion, diced\n", "4 cloves cookbook:garlic, thinly sliced\n", "2 teaspoons fresh cookbook:thyme leaves (or one half teaspoon dried)\n", "4 teaspoons fresh cookbook:basil leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried)\n", "85 grams (3 ounces) red w:bell pepper, diced\n", "1.3 kilograms (1 pound and 14 ounces) skinless plum cookbook:tomato, crushed by hand\n", "1 tablespoon w:sugar\n", "salt to taste\n"], "id": 42010, "procedure": ""}, {"category": null, "title": "Marinated Cucumbers and Onions", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Very Inexpensive recipes", "Very Easy recipes", "Salad recipes", "Vegetarian recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Marinated Cucumbers and Onions", "ingredient_count": 7, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 2 cookbook:Cucumber\n", " 1 white cookbook:Onion\n", " 2 Cups (480 mL) distilled white cookbook:Vinegar\n", " 2 Teaspoons (10 mL) cookbook:Vegetable Oil\n", " 1 teaspoon (5 mL) cookbook:sugar\n", " 1 teaspoon (5 mL) cookbook:salt\n", " These are estimates and you should mix the marinade ingredients to taste\n"], "id": 110796, "procedure": "Procedure p\npolli Mix vinegar, oil, salt and sugar for the marinade.\nli Trim the ends from the cucumbers, peel them and slice them.\nli Peel the onion and slice it as thinly as possible.\nli Pour the marinade over the cucumbers and onions and mix well.\nli Let it sit in a cool place or refrigerate for at least two hours, stirring occasionally.\npServe in a bowl, marinade and all, using salad tongs or a slotted spoon to dish out servings.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Marinated Green Olives", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Olive recipes", "Duplicate recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Marinated Green Olives", "ingredient_count": 11, "servings": null, "ingredients": ["2 cups (16oz/450g) unpitted large green Spanish olives\n", "7 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n", "2 bay leaves\n", "1/2 medium lemon, sliced\n", "1 teaspoon dried oregano\n", "1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds\n", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin seeds\n", "1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary\n", "1/2 teaspoon Spanish paprika\n", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n"], "id": 66209, "procedure": "Procedurep\npolli Lightly crush the olives with a mallet, or make slight slits on each olive with a knife, to ensure that the marinade permeates them.  \nli Place the olives in a sealable glass jar and add the remaining ingredients.  \nli Fill the jar with water and shake well.  \nli Marinate at room temperature for several days to a week.\npServe the olives with toasted almonds and fresh bread.\np{{PAGENAME}}\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Marinated Mackerel", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Cornish recipes", "Fish recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Marinated Mackerel", "ingredient_count": 9, "servings": null, "ingredients": ["4 or more Fish\n", "2 chopped fresh Bay Leaf\n", "6 Clove\n", "blade of Mace\n", "sprig of fresh Thyme\n", "1 chopped Onion\n", "10 Pepper\n", "Salt\n", "Malt vinegar\n"], "id": 115287, "procedure": "Procedure p\nolli Clean & scale fish, place in dish large enough for fish & vinegar.\nli Mix other ingredients, except vinegar, with salt to taste, & cast over fish.\nli Pour over sufficient vinegar to cover well.\nli Place in moderate oven for 40 to 50 minutes.\nli Lift fish carefully onto serving dish, strain liquor over.\nli Let cool & serve.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Marmeladetascherl", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Austrian recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Marmeladetascherl", "ingredient_count": 7, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 250g flour\n", " 1 teaspoon baking powder\n", " 250g butter\n", " 1 package curd\n", " a pinch of salt\n", " 1 albumen\n", " jam (you can also use nut cream for the stuffing) \n"], "id": 180414, "procedure": "Procedurep\npolliMix the flour with the baking powder and add the butter.

(optional)\n", "1 packet of dry winemaker's Yeast (Lalvin EC1118, K1V1116 or similar) as well as yeast nutrient.\n"], "id": 30449, "procedure": "Procedurep\npSome mead makers prefer to create a starter culture by preparing a mixture of one cup of room temperature sanitized fruit juice and the freeze dried winemaking yeast and placing it into a smaller one quart sanitized container fitted with a rubber stopper and airlock for a day or two until the mixture is bubbling. This container is kept at room temperature out of direct sunlight. This starter culture will cause the fermentation below to begin with vigor and may prevent the mead from failing to ferment.\npHoney is slowly added to a large pot half-full with water while heating. There is a common disagreement among mead makers as to whether you should boil the honey or not; mead makers have had success with either method. Boiling will alter the flavor, but will enhance the clarity of the finished mead. As the mead is heated over medium heat, it will nearly boil after the honey has been completely dissolved.\npAfter a time of heating the honey (which helps it dissolve and can also pasteurize it), the mixture is cooled to between (170\u00b0F/76\u00b0C) and (140\u00b0F/60\u00b0C) and the raisins are added. The mixture continues to cool, then is transferred to the carboy. Once it has cooled to room temperature (68\u00b0F/20\u00b0C), yeast which has been rehydrated is added to the honey/water mixture (must) and the airlock is put on. After being placed in a cool (68\u00b0F/20\u00b0C), dark place for a few hours or a day, the airlock should start to allow bubbles to escape. This is waste carbon dioxide (COsub2) and shows that the yeast is processing the sugar into alcohol. The raisins rise to the surface of the fermenting mixture. If they block the airlock, the mead maker will have to rack. Stirring or agitating the mixture is avoided, as it may cause the liquid to rise up and spill out of the airlock.\npAfter a four to six week period the mead maker may want to rack the mead into a second sanitized carboy. An airlock is not necessary during primary (aerobic) fermentation. This racking will clear out the lees and allow the mead to clear faster. The mead is siphoned into the second carboy via a sanitized tube, usually filled it with sterile water to start the siphon. The mead is siphoned carefully to avoid splashing as excess oxygen at this point may cause an unpleasant taste in the final product. An airlock is placed on the second carboy. It is imperative that sterile conditions be maintained while the carboys are open to avoid infection. The mead is racked in another 3 months or when all signs of fermentation have stopped (usually when the airlock doesn't produce any bubbles for a long period of time\u2014typically over 30 seconds between bubbles) and your mead has cleared. Excessive racking will promote oxidation, resulting in an undrinkable mead. The carboy is clear enough when it is possible to read a newspaper through it. The mead will then need to age, usually one year, and anywhere up five or more. Bulk aging can be done done in a tertiary carboy, but bottle aging is also common.\npThen next step is to bottle the mead. Mead is generally sealed in sanitized bottles using airtight caps or quality corks. If the fermentation is not complete, pressure will build up inside the sealed bottles and cause them to explode. Mead is generally aged for at least 6 months in the bottle before drinking.\np{{Wikipedia|Mead}}\nhr\n:''This module uses text from the Wikipedia module Mead'' under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

Another tip is to leave the pavlova in the oven after turning off the heat - this helps to prevent the middle of the pavlova from collapsing (although if it does collapse, generous application of cream can hide any mistakes!)\np{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}\n{{PAGENAME}}"}, {"category": null, "title": "Pawpaw Chutney", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Pawpaw recipes", "Chutney recipes", "Recipes with metric units"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Pawpaw Chutney", "ingredient_count": 18, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 2-1/2 cups lemon juice\n", " 8 ounces (225g) sugar\n", " 4 tablespoon bruised Ginger\n", " 2 bay leaves\n", " 2 blades mace\n", " 6 whole cloves\n", " 1/2 cinnamon quill\n", " 2 tablespoon white Peppercorn\n", " 1 tablespoon white mustard seed\n", " 2 teaspoons asofoetida\n", " 1 teaspoon Salt\n", " 3 1/4 pound (1.5kg) pawpaw ripe or slightly under ripe\n", " 2 1/4 pound (1.1kg) ripe Tomato skinned\n", " 2 hot chilies seeds removed\n", " 1 pound (450g) sultanas\n", " 2 tablespoon finely grated ginger\n", " 1 tablespoon salt\n", " 1 pound (450g) brown sugar \n"], "id": 277832, "procedure": "Procedure p\npolliPlace all ingredients in a large stainless steel pot and bring slowly to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. \nliSimmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 1 hour. \nliStrain lemon juice and pour into sterilized bottles for further use. \nliChutney: dice pawpaw and place in a large stainless steel pot with remaining ingredients and 2 liters of lemon juice. \nliSlowly bring to the boil, then simmer for 2 hours or until the mixture has a jam-like consistency. \nliRemove from heat and spoon into sterilized jars and seal immediately. \nliStore in a dark cool place.

Add the salt.  Stirring constantly with a stainless steel whisk, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream.  Reduce heat to a slow simmer and keep stirring with the whisk until it starts to boil, then cover and continue to cook, stirring every 2-3 minutes with a wooden spoon, always in the same clockwise direction.  \npThe time necessary for the porridge to be correctly cooked and thus well-digestible is 45 minutes.  In case the porridge gets too thick, add some hot water or skimmed milk, to obtain a more creamy porridge.  Check frequently if more salt is needed.  \npFor eating polenta hot from the pan, put a tablespoon of water in a deep ceramic dish and scrape the polenta into it. Serve it with a big wooden spoon.  To eat it roasted, scrape the polenta into a non-stick pan or ceramic dish (or some container which will release it when it cools).  Cool completely.  The polenta will be like a loaf.  To serve it, cut into slices, heat in the oven or grill it and serve with whatever topping you desire.  Even the polenta leftovers from serving it as a hot side dish are usable, cut in slices and grilled.\nThe quickie methodp\npBoil the water on the stove.  Pour it into a large microwave-safe bowl and add the salt. Stirring constantly, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream.  Cook the polenta in a microwave oven on medium power for (2\u20135 minutes, longer for a larger serving).  Remove from the microwave and stir vigorously.  It will not cook evenly and this stirring helps prevent lumps.  \npRepeat this process until the polenta is thick, then proceed as above.\nThe really quickie methodp\npBoil the water, toss in the salt and cornmeal and microwave on medium power for 5\u20138 minutes (depending on quantity).  Remove from microwave and stir like crazy to smash all of the lumps.  Repeat if you need to thicken it some more, stir, and blend with the few remaining lumps.\nVariationsp\nJust before you take the polenta off the heat (i.e., when it's almost done), stir in any of the following.\nulli Two tablespoons of olive oil or butter and about half a cup of cheese.\nli Two tablespoons of olive oil, 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, and a quarter cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes.

Top with carmelized onions.\npPolenta is also delicious topped with your favorite tomato sauce or with an assortment of grilled vegetables. Chilled, firm polenta may be served cut into triangles alongside chili or other hearty stews.

(1/2 stick) unsalted butter to coat skin of turkey\n", " 1/2 gallon of water\n", " 2 gallons of ice water (50% ice)\n"], "id": 4167, "procedure": "Roasting Procedurep\nThe tricky thing about cooking poultry is that the dark meat needs to be about 15 degrees hotter than the white meat. White meat is safe to eat at 165\u00b0F (73.9\u00b0C), which is the temperature at which salmonella instantly dies. (Though 12 minutes at 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) will kill it as well, so odds are fairly good that, for a roast, you'll kill it all on the way to 165\u00b0F (73.9\u00b0C)) The problem is that dark meat isn't very good at 165\u00b0F (73.9\u00b0C). Further complicating this is that if the breast meat gets to the 180\u00b0F (82.2\u00b0C) that the dark meat wants to be cooked to, it's going to be dry, flavorless, and generally unpleasant.\npThe white meat parts of the turkey are the breasts and wings. The dark meat are the thighs and drumsticks. Now, the wings and drumsticks are going to cook a bit faster than the bits of meat that are better attached to the bird. That said, you want the drumsticks cooked more, so don't worry so much about them. The wings, however, are probably worth attaching more firmly to the bird. You can do this by imagining you were twisting someone's arm behind their back.  Do this with both wings.  Once you figure out the right twist, you'll find that the tips of the wings will stay firmly in place near the center of the back of the turkey (near its backbone).\npNext:\nolliPreheat the oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). (You'll drop the temperature later, but start it hot to get a crispier, more flavorful skin. The effect will be to keep the fat from melting and rolling down the side of the turkey, which is only going to dry it out.) Roast at lowest level of the oven.\nliPlace the turkey drumstick side down on a roasting tray (with slots to allow drippings through into a pan), or on a rack sitting in a pan.  You will need a basting tool to get the drippings from this pan throughout the roasting process.\nliPlace the turkey in the oven.\nliAfter about 30 minutes, drop the heat to 350 \u00b0F (176.7\u00b0C), remove from oven and put a tent of aluminum foil loosely over the breast of the turkey. This is going to keep the breast meat from overcooking and drying out.\nliFor optimum safety and uniform doneness, it is recommended to cook stuffing outside the bird. #The internal temperature should be checked with a food thermometer and the breast must reach a minimum of 161 \u00b0F (71.67\u00b0C) before removing it from the oven. The thigh, ideally, will be around 180\u00b0F (82.2\u00b0C) at this point.  It should take about 2 3/4 to 3 hours to reach this temperature, a 14-16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2hours of roasting. \nliLet the bird stand 15-20 minutes before carving.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Roasted Chicken Nachos With Green Chili-Cheese Sauce", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Chile recipes", "Cheese recipes", "Chicken recipes", "Southwestern recipes", "Recipes_with_metric_units"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Roasted Chicken Nachos With Green Chili-Cheese Sauce", "ingredient_count": 14, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 4 medium Tomatillo, husked and rinsed (or used canned if unavailable)\n", " 2 Jalape\u00f1o, stemmed \n", " 1/2 medium Onion, peeled and quartered \n", " 2 Garlic clove, peeled \n", " 1 handful fresh Cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped \n", " 1 Lime, juiced \n", " 1 Teaspoon Toasting Cumin seeds \n", " Kosher (coarse or margarita) Salt \n", " 1/4 Cup [60ml] (1/2 stick) unsalted Butter \n", " 1/4 cup all-purpose [60ml] Flour \n", " 2 cups Chicken (480ml) Stock, at room temperature \n", " 4 cups shredded (950ml) Monterey Jack Cheese \n", " 1 (1-Pound) (450g) bag salted corn tortilla chips \n", " 1 (3-pound) whole (1350g) Roasting chicken, Meat finely shredded, skin and bones discarded\n"], "id": 26817, "procedure": ""}, {"category": null, "title": "Roasted eggplant", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Romanian recipes", "Eggplant recipes", "Vegan recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Roasted eggplant", "ingredient_count": 3, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" Eggplant\n", " Oil\n", " Salt\n"], "id": 123798, "procedure": "Procedurep\nolli Take one eggplant or more roast it in a old pan with oil.

Ensure that the syrup froths all the time while cooking the rasgullas.\nli   Cook for about 15 minutes, continuously sprinkling water to enable the froth to form.\nli   Check if the rasgullas are cooked.

You may skim fat off the surface, if so desired (traditionally it should be as fat as possible)\nliAdding vegetable stock or a stock cube is a personal choice. Some argue that it is unnecessary, as the vegetable and meat give enough flavour to the broth.\nliRemove cabbage, parsley, celery root and any \"undesired\" vegetables.

Let stand at room temperature for 10 to 12 days.  Punch down the dough once a day.  If the dough becomes watery, knead in some more flour.  Let stand until the dough no longer rises and has lost its stretch.  Rub the dough between your hands onto a tray covered with parchment paper so that it forms small pieces.  Cover the tray with cheesecloth or other protective mesh and leave to dry in a cool, well ventilated place.  As it dries, break the dough into smaller pieces eventually crumbling it as small as you can.  When it is completely dry (a week or more) pulverize in a blender, a little at a time.  Store in freezer bags or large jars.  Store in a cool place or refrigerate. May be kept up to twelve months.\nli To make tarhana soup, mix 1 cup of the dried dough mix with 3 cups of water or meat stock. Mix with a wooden spoon until softened.  Add more water or stock to make a thickish soup with a creamy consistency. Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour into bowls and garnish with cro\u00fbtons, parsley, or paprika-infused butter or olive oil, if desired.

Drain in colander and use a brush to remove any bloody meat.\nli5. Use a saw and cut halfway down the center of the bones. Then use hammer to break bone.\nli6. The bones will be filled with marrow. Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.\nli7. Scum will form at the start. Carefully skim the scum off. On mid flame, maintain a low boil.\nli8. After scum has stopped forming, simmer for 6 hours or more. Add more water if the water level drops.\nli9. Now to make the noodles. After measuring out the ingredients, mix the flour and kansui together, then add the water. It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient. This is normal.\nli10. Mix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved.\nli11. The dough will be very stiff. Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.\nli12. Transfer to kneading surface and knead. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes. It is ok if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.\nli13. Form into ball, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the dough does not dry out.\nli14. While the dough rests, prepare the char siu. Brown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients. Allow to cool in the pot.\nli15. After the dough has rested, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine. Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved.\nli16. If a pasta machine is not used, roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin. Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.\nli17. The dough will not be that sticky, so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring. (Note that the recipe only shows the noodles being cut by a pasta machine and does not mention hand cutting)\nli18. A wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.\nli19. 2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.\nli20. After the soup has simmered for 6 hours, the soup should look like this. The inside of the bones should now be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.\nli21.The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.\nli22. It\u2019s time to put everything together. Since boiling time can differ, boil the noodles to each person\u2019s preference. For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.\nli23. Warm the bowl, and add the char siu sauce and salt for flavor. Use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.\nli24. I prefer to boil the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Your rich and hearty tonkotsu ramen is complete.\n"}, {"category": null, "title": "Torta de Acelga", "time": null, "difficulty": null, "related_categories": ["Gibraltarian recipes", "Pie recipes", "Vegetarian recipes"], "link": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Torta de Acelga", "ingredient_count": 8, "servings": null, "ingredients": [" 1 small pkt Puff pastry (or else make a pastry by mixing one glass each of Olive Oil and Water then adding Flour until a soft Dough is achieved)\n", " 6 bunches of Chard (chard)\n", " 6 Egg\n", " Bread Crumb\n", " Grater Cheese\n", " Parsley\n", " 2 teaspoons Mincing Garlic\n", " Season to taste\n"], "id": 108439, "procedure": "Procedurep\npolli Remove the stems of the acelga (these stems will become useful for another recipe called Potaje de acelga). \nli Wash the leaves very well to remove any grit or soil.
